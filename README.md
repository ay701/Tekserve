Some of projects I designed and developed in Tekserve

-----------------------------------------------------

**Apple Web Report Application**

The goal is to build a web application which allows financial department to overview all Apple products sale performance in the last 4 quarters, including customer information as well

Regardless of the huge amount of dataset, the report should load and display results in a fairly fast speed

The report should contain filters like amount limit, division types, etc.

The report should contain search feature, so financial heads would be able to quickly find out information they need

There might be future addition to the report, please make sure the app is scalable, meanwhile the loading efficiency should keep sharp

-----------------------------------------------------

**FIFO Inventory Tracking App**

This app is designed to track all in-stock items information

The app allows the company to find out total in-house value of all inventory item at the current time point 

Plus, user can click to see the detailed information about any item

Including: location, number of in-house, total value, purchased value, number sold, manufacturer and other info

When customer made a return, FIFO app should be able to push the returned item to the stack and find out the price from purchase order

By end of every week, month and year, it should capture the snapshot and save to database, at the same time sending out emails to company heads with reports attached
