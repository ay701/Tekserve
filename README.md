Some of projects I designed and developed in Tekserve

-----------------------------------------------------

Apple Report

The goal is to build a web application which allows financial department to overview all Apple products sale performance in the last 4 quarters, including customer information as well

Regardless of the huge amount of dataset, the report should load and display results in a fairly fast speed

The report should contain filters like amount limit, division types, etc.

The report should contain search feature, so financial heads would be able to quickly find out information they need

There might be future addition to the report, please make sure the app is scalable, meanwhile the loading efficiency should keep sharp
